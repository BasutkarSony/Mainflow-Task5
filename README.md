2. Evaluated and labeled pass/fail status for each student in Math and Science with CASE logic.
3. Created and populated the `StudentScores` table with sample data.

## How to Run

1. Use any MySQL client such as MySQL Workbench or phpMyAdmin.
2. Execute the `Task-5.sql` script step-by-step in the given order.
3. Review query outputs to see grade assignments and pass/fail statuses.
